* General notes
- How to operate with big numbers in Julia?
  - I can not use int values, since its lame to have only 16 bytes for UInt128 in Julia. However, apperently, I can use the Julia's BigInt to store extremely big numbers, since its an arbitrary precision integer, which relies solely on RAM (I have 24GB, so its pretty enough).
